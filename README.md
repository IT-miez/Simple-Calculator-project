# The Odin Project -  Simple calculator project
This project was made while doing The Odin Project. </br>
The calculator has a screen with the inputted text, buttons for adding numbers, basic calculation buttons and reset + delete character buttons</br><br>

## Live site
GitHub Pages site: https://it-miez.github.io/Simple-Calculator-project/
</br></br>

## Technologies used
**HTML** </br>
**CSS** (styling, flexbox, hover-effects)</br>
**JavaScript** (event-listeners, DOM-manipulation (calculator screen), calculating functions and modifying the calculator screen based on inputs)</br></br>

## What I learned
I used my skills on **flexboxes** when structuring the site. I used **JavaScript** to **manipulate the DOM-elements based on what input user puts and to do the math operations the user wanted**.</br>
In this project I **used my JavaScript-skills**, **and** got to use **flexboxes** again when structuring the website.
